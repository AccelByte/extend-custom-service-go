# 1. Introduction

We'll be exploring game backend development, focusing on building a custom Guild Service using gRPC, gRPC-Gateway, and AccelByte services.

## 1.1 Purpose of This Guide

This guide serves to:

- Provide a practical walkthrough for developers on creating a custom backend service for a game, using a Guild Service as our relevant example.

- Demonstrate how to leverage powerful technologies like gRPC, gRPC-Gateway, and AccelByte's CloudSave service.

## 1.2 What You Will Achieve

By the end of this guide, you will:

- Understand the core concepts and operations of a Guild Service.
- Setup your development environment with Go, gRPC, gRPC-Gateway, and ProtoBuf compiler.
- Build a new endpoint and write service implementations.
- Test your service implementations and troubleshoot common issues.
- Appreciate the benefits and considerations of creating a custom backend service.

Let's get started with our journey into game backend development!
